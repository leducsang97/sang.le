			Hi! I'm Sang Le. I'm a recent graduate from Lawrence University, where I earned my undergraduate degree in math
			and computer science. I'm currently working at Dodles as a Software Engineer focus on Front End. The project that
			I have been working on is Hashtagr, which helps customer boost their interactions on social media platforms. The
			tech stacks I used are React/Redux with the Material UI theme. On top of that, we use Cordova to translate
			Javascript App to Mobile Native App. The application is currently available in the App Store, Google Play, and
			website. If you have some time, check it out, and lets it alleviate your Instagram or LinkedIn experience. I
			included more information about myself below, and feel free to reach out as I am always open to new opportunities
			and challenges.
